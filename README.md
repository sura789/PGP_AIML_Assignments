# PGP_AIML_Assignments

This repository contains all 11 assignments I completed during the Post Graduate Program (PGP) in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) from Great Learning (2021-2022). These Python-based assignments showcase various machine learning, data science, and AI concepts that I learned and implemented throughout the course.

## Assignment Summaries

1. **Assignment 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Conducted in-depth analysis on a structured dataset, addressing missing values, visualizing distributions, identifying anomalies, and deriving initial insights. This assignment laid the foundation for understanding the dataset and preparing it for further analysis.

2. **Assignment 2: Regression Analysis**  
   Developed and evaluated regression models, including simple and multiple linear regression, to predict continuous target variables. Applied techniques such as feature selection, multicollinearity checks, and residual analysis to ensure model robustness.

3. **Assignment 3: Classification Techniques**  
   Explored supervised learning methods for classification tasks. Implemented algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and evaluated them using confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores.

4. **Assignment 4: Clustering Methods**  
   Applied unsupervised learning techniques to segment data into meaningful groups. Used K-Means, Hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN algorithms, analyzing the formed clusters with metrics such as silhouette scores and elbow method for optimal cluster determination.

5. **Assignment 5: Dimensionality Reduction**  
   Reduced the complexity of datasets while preserving key information. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were employed to visualize high-dimensional data and enhance model performance by reducing overfitting.

6. **Assignment 6: Time Series Analysis**  
   Analyzed time-dependent data to identify patterns like trends and seasonality. Built forecasting models using techniques such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and Exponential Smoothing to predict future values accurately.

7. **Assignment 7: Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
   Processed and analyzed textual data. Implemented tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization techniques, and performed sentiment analysis and topic modeling using tools like NLTK and spaCy.

8. **Assignment 8: Neural Networks and Deep Learning**  
   Built and trained deep learning models using frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras. Covered architectures such as Fully Connected Neural Networks (FNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to solve tasks like image recognition and sequence prediction.

9. **Assignment 9: Reinforcement Learning**  
   Delved into reinforcement learning, focusing on Q-Learning and policy optimization techniques. Simulated environments where agents learned optimal strategies through trial and error to maximize rewards.

10. **Assignment 10: Model Deployment**  
    Explored the end-to-end lifecycle of deploying machine learning models into production. Covered topics like API creation using Flask, model versioning, and integrating models with real-world applications.

11. **Assignment 11: Capstone Project**  
    The culmination of the PGP AIML program, this capstone project integrated multiple AI and ML concepts to address a real-world problem. It involved end-to-end data handling, from preprocessing to model building and deployment, showcasing a holistic application of the learned skills.
